1.We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of
100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B. Create an abstract
class 'Marks' with an abstract method 'getPercentage'. It is inherited by two other
classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method with the same name which returns the
percentage of the students. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three
subjects as its parameters and the marks in four subjects as its parameters for student
B. Create an object for eac of the two classes and print the percentage of marks for both
the students.




2. Write a program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address)
of three employees by creating a class named 'Employee'. The output should be as
follows:
Name Year of joining Address

3. Create a class called Book to represent a book. A Book should include four pieces of information
as instance variables‚Äêa book name, an ISBN number, an author name and a publisher. Your class
should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables. Provide a mutator method
and accessor method (query method) for each instance variable. In addition, provide a method
named getBookInfo that returns the description of the book as a String (the description should
include all the information about the book). You should use this keyword in member methods
and constructor. Write a test application named BookTest to create an array of object for 30
elements for class Book to demonstrate the class Book's capabilities.
